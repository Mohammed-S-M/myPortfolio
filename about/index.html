        I was born and raised in Baghdad, Iraq. I lived my childhood and teenage years
         in my country until I became 18, then moved into a neighboring country. After 
         a few years, I moved into the United States of America when I was 21 years old.

         Since I was a child, I have loved computers and have always wondered how this 
         incredible machine works in hardware and software. It was magical for me. 
         Looking at the screen makes me happy as I keep wondering how this thing works. 
         When I became a teenager, my parents bought me my first computer, and that was 
         the starting point of experiencing what was that magical machine all about. 
         I started to experiment on the software part and the hardware. Start to learn 
         how to format the PC and install the Windows operating system. Experimenting 
         on many software applications from Photoshop to Microsoft office, it was a 
         world of unlimited possibilities. Also, I used to save all the money my parents 
         used to give me to upgrade my hardware. In other words, the computer was my life 
         and still.
        </p>
        <br>
       <p class="paragraphs">
        However, since I came to the US, the world of possibilities was open for me to 
        learn how this remarkable machine works, so I decided to pursue a computer 
        science major. Since I started learning about computers in deep learning, 
        I realized my love for coding started growing as I learned Java, C, and C++. 
        However, that was not enough for me, and I wanted to see every possible coding 
        path to choose where I wanted to be. After deep searching online, I fell in love 
        with web development, especially the front-end part. So I decided to be a 
        self-learner in the learning path to be a front-end web developer, and 
        I love every step of the way. Web development is a vast world, and there are 
        no limits to learning in this field.
